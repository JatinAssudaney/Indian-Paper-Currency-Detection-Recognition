# Indian-Paper-Currency-Detection-Recognition
As per the WHO, an expected 253 million individuals live with vision debilitation: 36 million are visually impaired and 217 million have direct to extreme vision weakness and 81% of individuals who are visually impaired or have direct or serious vision hindrance are matured 50 years or more. Among this number, highest percentage of 15 million people from India. It is very difficult to do daily routines independently for visually impaired and to identify Indian banknotes, particularly while accepting their money back when shopping for their daily needs is a challenging task. The differences in texture or length of currency bills are not really sufficient for identification by the visually impaired. Moreover, bills are not as easy to distinguish by touch as coins. Certain unique engravings are printed on the bills of different currencies but they tend to wear away.
