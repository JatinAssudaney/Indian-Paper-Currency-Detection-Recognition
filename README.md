# Indian-Paper-Currency-Detection-Recognition
## Introduction
Object recognition is an important and highly demanded area of pattern recognition. An object can be anything in real life. It can be text in a document, a license plate of a vehicle, an iris in a personâ€™s eyes, a sign in a sign language, a face of a person, and so on. Similarly, paper currency recognition is as important as any other object recognition.
The differences in texture or length of currency bills are not really sufficient for identification by the visually impaired. Moreover, bills are not as easy to distinguish by touch as coins. Certain unique engravings are printed on the bills of different currencies but they tend to wear away.
